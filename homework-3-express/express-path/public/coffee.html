	<h1>My favorite coffee</h1>
	<p>My Favorite Coffee was officially introduced to Smosh fans on October 14, 2019 in the video Every Coffee Shop Ever, the final scene of which served as somewhat of an advertisement for the coffee. According to Ian Hecox, the coffee is ethically sourced, specialty grade, and is available in two blends and a cold brew. Fans could order the coffee off the website with a link in the description. Later that month, My Favorite Coffee was added to the Smosh Store and an official YouTube channel was launched.</p>

	<p>On March 1, 2023, Smosh announced the discontinuation of My Favorite Coffee through their social media accounts, and the website was shut down on March 24, 2023. In a reply to one of the comments on their Instagram page, Smosh cited the reason for its discontinuation, stating that the brand was "not given the attention and support it deserves" as early as late 2022.[1] Some of the final pre-orders also came with Ian's signature.</p>
