	<p>Transit of Venus was the album that came out when I started listening to TDG when I was 8 years old. It immediately made me fall in love with their music and I listened to their entire discography. Eventually I realized Life Starts Now is what I always come back to when listening to them. All my favorite songs are on that album.</p>
